    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I've done HTML & CSS. I've used Haml, Jade, Sass, Less, and Mustache. Almost every website I've made has used Bootstrap.</li>
      <li>I'm pretty good with Javascript. I've also used JQuery. I should probably pick up Angular JS.</li>
      <li>I started doing web dev with Ruby on Rails. Then I picked up Node.js. Recently I've been working with DropWizard.</li>
      <li>The only website I have in production is a static site for a non-profit. Other demo projects I've made have used the Google Maps API.</li>
